# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This collection showcases my work in various Python programming concepts and applications during my journey at ITI.

My aim is to demonstrate my problem-solving skills, code organization, and proficiency in different Python libraries and paradigms.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Core Python:** Data types, control flow, functions, error handling.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
* **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples.
* **Modular Programming:** Organizing code into functions and modules.
* **Specific Topics:**
    * Email Validation (e.g., using regular expressions or specific libraries)
    * Multi-inheritance concepts
    * Story assignments (likely involving logic and data manipulation)

## Projects Overview

### 1. Check Email validation

* **Description:** This project implements various methods to validate email addresses, ensuring they conform to standard formats and potentially checking for domain validity.
* **Key Features:** (e.g., Regular expressions, handling edge cases, testing different email patterns.)

### 2. Functions

* **Description:** A collection of Python functions demonstrating modular programming and reusable code. This includes examples of different function types, arguments, and return values.


### 3. Multi-inheritance & OOP Story assignments

* **Description:** This section contains assignments and examples exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python, with a specific focus on multi-inheritance. It also include story-based problems solved using OOP concepts.
* **Key Concepts:** (e.g., Class and object creation, single and multiple inheritance, method resolution order (MRO), polymorphism, encapsulation.)
